        <h3>Phonological encoding and phonetic cue weighting</h3>
        <p>How does the brain encode the same sound differently across languages? This project examines how language-specific phonological patterns shape neural representations of speech. Although the flap [ɾ] occurs in both English and Korean, its phonological status differs: in English, it patterns with [t]; in Korean, with [l]. Using EEG, we probe whether this phonological structuring influences how the brain encodes [ɾ], testing how abstract linguistic categories interact with early neural processing.</p>

        <h3>Phonological encoding and phonetic cue weighting</h3>
        <p>How does the brain determine whether a sound is /g/ or /k/? The answer lies in how listeners weight different phonetic cues. For instance, voicing contrasts in English stops are primarily cued by voice onset time (VOT), with fundamental frequency (F0) serving as a secondary cue. In this project, we combines behavioral identification tasks with EEG recordings of mismatch negativity (MMN) to explore two key questions: 1.Can secondary cues like F0 contribute to the brain’s pre-attentive encoding of phonological categories? 2.Do individual differences in MMN responses reflect how listeners differentially weight these cues?</p>
