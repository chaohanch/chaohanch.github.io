Hi, I’m Chao Han, a PhD candidate in the Department of Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the University of Delaware. I obtained my MA in Linguistics and Applied Linguistics from the School of English and International Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University.

My research goal is to understand how we perceive and process speech sounds, how the brain extracts abstract categories from varying acoustic cues, and how the categories are represented, in both typical and clinical populations. To answer those questions, I use both behavioral and EEG techniques. My current project asks whether and how a phoneme representation encodes acoustic details, using the auditory oddball paradigm.
