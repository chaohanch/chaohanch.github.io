Hi, I am a postdoctoral researcher in cognitive neuroscience and speech perception at the University of Toronto Scarborough, working with [Dr. Philip Monahan](https://phijomo.github.io/) in the [Computation and Psycholinguistics Laboratory (CAP Lab)](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/labs/caplab/).

My research focuses on how the brain processes and represents speech sounds, using behavioral and EEG experiments, I study the encoding of speech sounds in typical and clinical populations, exploring questions like how phonological representations retain acoustic details and how factors such as typicality and perceptual context influence memory encoding.
