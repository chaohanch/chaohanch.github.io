My research aims to understand how we perceive and process speech sounds, how the brain extracts an abstract category from the varying acoustic cues, and how this category is represented, in both typical and clinical populations. To answer those questions, I use both behavioral and EEG techniques. My current project asks whether and how a phoneme representation encodes acoustic details, using the auditory oddball paradigm.
