Hello! Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto Scarborough. I work with [Dr. Philip Monahan](https://phijomo.github.io/) to study how the brain transforms sounds into meaning, using behavioral and EEG experiments. Before coming to Toronto, I completed my PhD in linguistics and cognitive science at the University of Delaware under the supervision of [Dr. Arild Hestvik](https://udel.edu/~hestvik/). I also received training in applied linguistics as a master student at Beijing Foreign Studies University.

I'm currently working on the following questions:
- How do language-specific phonological patterns shape phonetic perception? [[poster](https://chaohanch.github.io/assets/files/flap_snl.pdf) at SNL2025]
- How does the brain weight temporal and spectral cues to distinguish speech sounds? [[poster](https://chaohanch.github.io/assets/files/laryngeal_snl.pdf) at SNL2025]
- How is prototypicality information about speech sounds encoded in the brain?
